Add nice priority to purge and cleanup scripts
Add replication scripts.
Add timestamps to output, for logging purposes.

In the future version, configuration should be done thorough object inheritance.
Idea is a bit similar to nagios configuration syntax.

### Configuration objects

Transfer timetable object:
- defines timetable at which backups are executed
- retries
Verification timetables
- timetables for backup transfer verification
- this is to prevent too frequent notifications if not too many backups fail

Module/path list object:
- which modules/paths are to be transferred

Destinations:
- destination paths where to store backups
- FUTURE: set how many concurrent backup jobs can run on the same destination
- FUTURE: set how many concurrent backup clone jobs can run on the same destination

Retention policies:
- how old backups are retained and/or deleted

Hosts:
- ips, access keys, ports, etc
- hosts have these objects assigned:
---> timetable
---> modules
---> destination
---> retention policy
- host inheritance should be supported (default host, with specific overrides)

Additional settings:
- concurrency (general, per destination, etc)
- timeouts
- less-than-a-day frequency (hour?)

Replication settings:
- replicate from backup host
- replicate either all or specific list hosts
- replicate hosts on certain remote destination



Push based backups for road warriors.
